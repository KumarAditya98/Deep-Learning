## Example: CNN for Image Classification - MNIST Dataset

This example is going to solve the same problem as `MLP\3_ImageClassification\example_MNIST.py` but using a CNN.

### New Code

- Reshaping to input into a Conv Layer.
- Convolutional and Pooling Layers. Flatten operation.


## Exercise: MLP for Image Classification - FashionMNIST Dataset

`exercise_FashionMNIST.py` asks to train a MLP on the [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, which is exactly the same as the MNIST dataset but replacing the digits with images of different types of clothing. It was made to have a harder benchmark for image classification models.

### New Code

- Zero-padding and Global Average Pooling.
