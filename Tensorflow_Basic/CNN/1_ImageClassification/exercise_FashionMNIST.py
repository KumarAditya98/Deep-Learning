# Fit a CNN to the FashionMNIST dataset: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

# 1. Download the data using keras.datasets.fashion_mnist

# 2. Run the same network as the one from the example. You should get around 91.5 % accuracy.

# 3. Try modifying the architecture and the hyper-parameters to get a better performance.
# Try including more conv layers and more kernels in each layer. This can allow for less MLP layers at the end.
# To do so, you will need to play around with zero-padding and maybe stack two conv layers together without any pooling.
# You can also remove the pooling and the MLP, and replace it with a final Global Average Pooling layer.
