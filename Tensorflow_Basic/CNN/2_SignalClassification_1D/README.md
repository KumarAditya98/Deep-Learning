## Example: 1D-CNN for Signal Classification - Human Activity Prediction

This example uses a 1D Convolution to classify input signals from a recorded with a [cellphone accelerometer](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php) into 6 classes: "Walking", "Jogging", "Upstairs", "Downstairs", "Sitting and "Standing". We slide a kernel across the temporal dimension to learn local features over the input sequence. 


### New Code

- `Conv1D`

## Exercise: Smarter Preprocessing and 1D-CNN for Signal Classification - Human Activity Prediction

This exercise shows some of the flaws of the example and asks to improve the pre-processing and the model accordingly.

### New Code

- None.
