## Neural Networks in Keras: MLPs, CNNs and RNNs

This directory contains several examples to train Neural Networks in [Keras](https://keras.io/). The MLP folder contains the simplest code and explains the basics. Each folder (MLP, CNN and RNN) shows several examples and exercises of increasing complexity. New code will be mentioned in a `README.md` for the corresponding example and explained on the actual script. If something is not explained, it is probably explained in a simpler version. This means that the CNN and RNN examples will most likely only explain things that are particular to these architectures.
